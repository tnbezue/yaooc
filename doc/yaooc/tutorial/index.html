<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
YAOOC (Yet Another Object Oriented C), as the name implies, is another framework that implements many of the features found in object
oriented languages -- such as C++.
YAOOC implements the following:
<ul>
<li>new/delete (for POD and custom classes)</li>
<li>custom classes</li>
<li>inheritance</li>
<li>polymorphism</li>
<li>exceptions</li>
<li>string class</li>
<li>container classes (vector, map, set, etc)</li>
<li>iterators</li>
<li>I/O streams</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The purpose of this tutorial is to provide readers an introduction to using the YAOOC framework. It is assumed that the reader has
a knowledge of object oriented languages.
</p>
<p>
As the tutorial progresses, you may be discouraged by the amount of tedious work than has to be performed.
The lesson on the YAOOC preprocessor shows how the preprocesor will perform much (>95%) of this tedious work making it
quite easy to create YAOOC classes. However, you should cover the preceding lessons in order to understand
the various pieces produced by the preprocessor.
</p>
<p>
There are other implementations of object oriented C.  An internet search will return several.  No comparisons will be made to the
other implementations.  It's left as an exercise for the reader.
</p>
<h3>Naming Convention</h3>
<p>
Much of the YAOOC functionality depends on a particular naming convention which will be revealed as the tutorial progresses.
</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>
The examples presented in this guide are located in the examples folder -- further divided by lesson in which example appears.
