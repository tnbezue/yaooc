<h2>Inheritance</h2>
<p>
For a yaooc_struct, inheritance as follows:
</p>
<pre><code>
  %class class_name : parent_name {
    ...
  };
</code></pre>
<p>
For &quot;%class&quot;, a parent is required.  If not specified, the parent will be &quot;yaooc_object&quot;.
&quot;%struct&quot; does not require a parent.  &quot;yaooc_object&quot; is defined as follows.
</p>
<pre><code>
  %class yaooc_object {
    table:
      void swap(pointer s) { }
  };
</code></pre>

<p>
Although possible, generally, a struct should not have a class as a parent and a class should not have a struct as a parent.
</p>
<p>
A class inherits all instance and table members.  Table members can be overriden.  An overridden should method should have
the same name and argument types.
</p>
<p>
For the my_string class, the swap method will be overridden with the following:
</p>
<pre><code>
  %class my_string : yaooc_object {
      ...
    instance:
      ...
    table:
      void swap(pointer o)
      {
        my_string_pointer other=o;  // pointer is a generic pointer, must use my_string_pointer
        char* temp=this->str;
        this->str=other->str;
        other->str=temp;
      }
  };
</code></pre>
<p>
When a class is inherited from another, the behavior of the type info methods is as follows.
</p>
<h3>Default Constructor</h3>
<p>
Any parent constructor can be used as an initializer.  If not specified, the parent default constructor is used. If a default constructor is not specified and
the class has instance variables defined, a default constructor is automatically generated.
</p>
</p>
<h3>Destructor</h3>
<p>
When an object is deleted, every destructor in reverse order of inheritance (the child destructor, the parent destructor, the parents' parent destructor, etc) will be called
until the root class is reached.  The destrutor should only destory the portion of the object that was
initialized at the current level of inheritance.  The ancestors will destroy their portions.
</p>
<h3>Copy Constructor</h3>
<p>
Any constructor for the current class or parent class can be specified as an initializer.  If no initilizers are specified, the current class default constructor is called.
As with default constructor, if the copy constructor is not defined and instance variables are defined, a copy constructor is automatically generated.
</p>
<h3>Assignment</h3>
<p>
Normally, the assignment method calls the parent assignment method and then assigns variables defined in this instance.
