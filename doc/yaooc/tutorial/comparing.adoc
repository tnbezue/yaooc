== Comparing Objects
Let's give my_string the ability to compare (==, !=, <, etc) with other my_string objects

[source,c]
----------------------------------
%struct my_string {
    ...
    // Used for comparing my_string objects
    // Returns <0 for lhs<rhs; 0 if lhs==rhs; and >0 if lhs>rhs
    int operator<=>(lhs,rhs)
    {
      // lhs and rhs are const pointers to my_string instances
      if(lhs->str == NULL) {
        if(rhs->str == NULL)
          return 0; /* both NULL, equal */
        else
          return -1; /* lhs is NULL, rhs is not.  NULL is less than not NULL */
      } else if(rhs->str == NULL)
        return 1; /* lhs is not NULL, rhs is NULL. non NULL greater than NULL */
      return strcmp(lhs->str,rhs->str); /* Both not null, compare the strings */
    }
    ...
  instance:
    char* str;
};
----------------------------------

=== Rich Compare

The rich compare method is used to compare object (==,!=,<,<=,>, and >=).
If a rich compare method is not defined, yaoocpp does not generate one.
Furthermore, any comparisons performed would be as if rich compare returned 0 -- thus all objects of this type would be equal.

As with assignment, traditional camparison operators should not be used to compare objects. The following table gives the methods to use for comparisons.


.Comparison methods
[options="header"]
|====================================
|Description|Operator|YAOOC method
|Equal to|==|op_eq(p1,p2)
|Not equal to|!=|op_ne(p1,p2)
|Less than|<|op_lt(p1,p2)
|Less than or equal to|<=|op_le(p1,p2)
|Greater than|>|op_gt(p1,p2)
|Greater than or equal to|>=|op_ge(p1,p2)
|====================================

The following compares if two my_string objects are equal.

[source,c]
----------------------------------
my_string_pointer p1=new(my_string);
my_string_pointer p2=new(my_string);
....
if(p1==p2) /* Again, valid C but most likely not what was intended */
  { puts("Equal"); }
if(op_eq(p1,p2)) /* Will perform comparisons as specified by rich compare method */
  { puts("Equal"); }
----------------------------------
