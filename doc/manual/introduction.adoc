== Introduction
YAOOC (Yet Another Object Oriented C), as the name implies,
is another framework that implements many of the features found in C++.

.YAOOC implements the following:
* new/delete (for POD and custom classes)
* custom classes
* inheritance
* polymorphism
* exceptions
* string class
* container classes (vector, map, set, etc)
* I/O streams
* iterators

The YAOOC PreProcessor (yaoocpp) is used to convert the YAOOC file into a C header and source file.
This manual will describe the content of the YAOOC file and options for the preprocessor.
