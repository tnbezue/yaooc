== Generic PreProcessor
YAOOCPP uses the generic preprocessor (https://files.nothingisreal.com/software/gpp/gpp.html).
It uses many of the same directives as the C preprocessor (include, define, if, etc)
However, the directives begin with '%' rather than '\#'.
Therefore, items that should be preprocessed in YAOOCPP, begin with '%'.
Items that should be preprocessed by the C preprocessor, begin with '#'.

=== Example
Consider the following code.

[source,c]
----------------------
%include <yaooc/object.yaooh>
#include <stdio.h>
----------------------

The first include statement is preprocessed when YAOOCPP is executed.
The second include statement is written to the C source file and will be preprocessed when the program is compiled.

The "%include" should only be used to include YAOOH (YAOOC header) files.
It should not be used to include C header files.

Likewise, "#include" should not be used to include YAOOH files.

See the GPP documentation for further information.
