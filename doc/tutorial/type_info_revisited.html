When a class is inherited from another, the behavior of the type info methods (default constructor, destructor, copy constructor,
assignment, and less than compare) behave.
</p>
<p>
If the default constructor for a derived class is defined, it is used to initialize the object.  If the default constructor is not
defined (NULL), then the parent default constructor is used.  If the parent default constructor is not defined, it's parent is used. If a non
NULL default constructor is not found, the object remains uninitialized.
</p>
<p>
When an object is delete, the destructor for that class (if not NULL) is called.  The parent destructor is then called; the parent's parent destructor; etc
until the root of the inheritance tree is reached.  If a non NULL destructor is not found, no action is taken.
</p>
<p>
The copy constructor behaves as the default constructor.  If copy constructor is NULL, The parent, then grand parent, are
