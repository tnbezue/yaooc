== Introduction
YAOOC (Yet Another Object Oriented C), as the name implies, is another framework that implements many of the features found in C++.

.YAOOC implements the following:
* new/delete (for POD and custom classes)
* custom classes
* inheritance
* polymorphism
* exceptions
* string class
* container classes (vector, map, set, etc)
* I/O streams
* iterators

This tutorial will provide readers an introduction to using the YAOOC framework. It is assumed that the reader has a knowledge of object oriented languages.

There are other implementations of object oriented C. An internet search will return several. No comparisons will be made to the other implementations. It's left as an exercise for the reader.
